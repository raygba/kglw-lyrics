                            <p>Look past the dying trees, beyond waterless seas<br>
                                Atop the horizon<br>
                                Adjacent to the sun<br>
                                I give my word that it's there - Magenta Mountain</p>

                            <p>What do you mean, you can't see it?<br>
                                My life must be a dream - a living fantasy<br>
                                Disappeared in hot air - Magenta Mountain</p>

                                Your eyes deceive you<br>

                                The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream<br>
                                Can't you see you've gone insane?</p>

                            <p>I packed my bags and my swag for the road<br>
                                Followed the bows of the ancient railroads<br>
                                Need to rendezvous where clouds can't misconstrue<br>
                                I'm certain it's real - Magenta Mountain</p>

                            <p>You will say I'm crazy<br>
                                I will go on my way because it's what I need<br>
                                I'd cross a thousand seas just to prove I'm not mad<br>

                            <p>It's you again<br>
                                Yeah!<br>
                                I thought I saw a statue blink and a bird with no head<br>
                                Land on a golden thread<br>
                                I rub my eyes<br>
                                What am I saying?<br>
                                There's nothing there</p>

                            <p>Magenta mountain<br>
                                Magenta mountain<br>
                                It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get<br>
                                Don't wanna be left<br>
                                Never not making it there</p>

                            <p> What was confusing is now seducing<br>
                                Imagination is a powerful thing<br>
                                I see a flash of purple stone closing in</p>

                            <p>Magenta mountain<br>
                                Magenta mountain<br>

                                Never not making it there</p>

                            <p>I am tectonic<br>
                                I am megalithic<br>
                                My spirit runs mauve<br>
                                I am the mountain of which you dream<br>
                                I see you now behind the lens looking back at me</p>

                            <p>We fell through a dream across clouds of glue<br>
                                Anamnesis crashing through</p>

                            <p>Nerdy kid at school with astral thoughts<br>
                                Wanted to be an astronaut<br>
                                So I could be alone in space<br>
                                Get away<br>
                                Dreamt of Kepler-22b<br>
                                That's the place for me</p>

                            <p>I didn't get the grades to be a NASA astronaut<br>
                                Couldn't knuckle down or focus on my schoolwork<br>
                                I became a ghetto engineer making shit out of glass<br>
                                To refract the light from distant stars<br>
                                Then I built a telescope<br>
                                So big<br>
                                Pointed it at Kepler-22b<br>
                                That's the place for me</p>

                            <p>Good for ya<br>

                            <p>Can you guess the first thing I seen on Kepler-22b?<br>
                                A telescope pointing back at me<br>

                                Let me tell you 'bout this 80's lady named Sadie<br>
                                She's wild like a witch<br>
                                She's more fly than quidditch<br>
                                Smoking winnies and drinking tinnies and glenfiddich<br>
                                She's a roller blader skating<br>

                                Eats blood and trouble<br>
                                Meddles in the metal in it<br>
                                She flies a handbag freak flag<br>
                                Dragon scale knapsack<br>
                                Fur, a pelt of mastodon<br>
                                Brings it on as carry on<br>
                                Sharp like parmesan<br>
                                Living non-partisan<br>

                                She's dressing up to fuck shit up</p>

                            <p>Hello love<br>

                                Moles on her nose so enormous<br>
                                The public, they can't ignore it<br>
                                Pitchforks banging on her door<br>
                                They wanna throw her overboard<br>
                                To see if she floats or sinks into the floor<br>
                                There she goes, bobbing on the surface<br>
                                As the peasants and servants start to yell, "Hooray, sell her to the circus"<br>

                            <p>I think I went too fast<br>
                                (You did)<br>
                                I think the car might crash<br>
                                (It will)<br>
                                I'll have to pull out the wings<br>

                                And feel the lift underfoot<br>

                                Such a crazy idea<br>

                                Like a kid with a magnifying glass<br>
                                Each summer is getting hotter than the one before</p>

                            <p>Red smoke<br>
                                Go away heatwave<br>
                                You're all around, north to the south<br>
                                Red smoke<br>
                                Go away heatwave<br>
                                You're burning down<br>
                                Our leaders are dumbfounded again</p>

                            <p> The answer<br>
                                Plain as day<br>
                                The answer<br>
                                Plain as day<br>
                                Drastic measures<br>
                                Must be made<br>
                                Before we incinerate</p>

                            <p>Red smoke<br>
                                The wool's been pulled<br>
                                The dust won't settle<br>
                                Red smoke<br>
                                The fools still rule<br>
                                The screaming kettles</p>

                            <p>Red smoke<br>
                                Go away heatwave<br>
                                You're all around, north to the south<br>
                                Red smoke<br>
                                Go away heatwave<br>
                                You're burning down<br>
                                Our leaders are dumbfounded again</p>

                                Praying to the gods at the top of the mountain<br>
                                You'd be better throwing all your pennies in a fountain<br>

                                I know your hands are up but I really can't stop<br>
                                The sword is sharp so I wanna chop, chop, chop, chop<br>

                            <p>Luck here, matters<br>
                                When walking under ladders<br>
                                'Cause time is an arrow<br>
                                And our little bow has no strings</p>

                                My little heart is cold as a morgue<br>
                                Let the weight of it drop like an iceberg<br>
