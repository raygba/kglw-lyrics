                                Who could we be?<br>
                                When my race is done, how did I run?<br>
                                Did I par the course and pass the baton on?</p>
                            <p>Vote with your feet<br>

                                Uniformity gave me a belly ache<br>
                                I want a mutiny<br>
                                My mind is finally awake<br>
                                Who could we be given equal opportunity?<br>
                                What could we see given equal chance to actually see change?</p>

                            <p> We're changing pace<br>
                                Higher stakes<br>
                                So called heroes wearing fake capes<br>
                                Critically acclaimed<br>
                                Clinically deranged<br>

                                Keep on frontin' 'til they hear the thumpin'<br>
                                Something's coming up the hallway out of the left field lane<br>
                                Hey<br>
                                My stomach's turning from the vermin up-skirt observing power hungry<br>
                                Tryna draw the curtains from the public person<br>
                                But there ain't no slicker villain that's deserving a serving on the killing floor<br>
                                Put 'em on the chopping board for all to see</p>
                            <p> I'm like a sniper hiding in the tower<br>
                                I'm picking them off one by one<br>
                                Gateway drug to the only solution<br>
                                Cutting out their tongues before they jump the gun<br>
                                I'm the like the cupid trying bring the love but you keep getting out of my range<br>
                                No strings on my bow with broken arrows<br>
                                Running low on ammo to make a change</p>
                            <p> Buildings that you know<br>

                                But lie within the walls and the significance will change<br>
                                What would it take for us to change the game?<br>
                                Maybe our existence is significance in vain<br>

                                Escape this old place with all that creeps and fish in the sea<br>
                                And all that flies and all the bugs inside of me<br>
                                Take all the good things and leave the human beings</p>

                                Her hips are too close for comfort<br>

                                My friend, it felt good</p>

                            <p>To shuffle off this mortal coil<br>
                                To rise like oil in water<br>
                                To be not real<br>
                                To have no soul, to have no body</p>

                            <p>I woke to an eye-adjusting fright<br>

                                And found myself in purgatory white<br>
                                Dead again in the void</p>

                            <p>What was the lesson, God? (No, no, no, no body)<br>
                                Are you real or not? (No, no, no, no body)</p>

                            <p>In death, I know<br>
                                Life was a hallucination</p>
