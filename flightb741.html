                            <p>There's a place I wanna go 'cause my ma and pa, they fight at home<br>
                                And though my feet may never grace the sand, it helps to give me hope<br>
                                Where the waters flow superluminally and where tachyons light heavenly<br>
                                Where Chang'e plays her superstrings<br>
                                They call it M.C.</p>

                            <p>What would it mean to be a beam travelling like lightning?<br>
                                Across cosmic ravine and to the city I have seen<br>
                                In the nazar of my eye, the skyline, at once dead and alive<br>
                                To see that picture in my mind, pull focus on the lens of time</p>

                            <p>Waves crashing down like a lion pride roar<br>
                                Beyond the break a heavenly haven shimmers in the open water<br>
                                The fortune teller never predicted this in her crystal ball<br>
                                Is that a city drifting from afar or a reflection mirage?</p>

                            <p>In the mirror ripples I get lost<br>
                                Wondering 'bout my ma and pa and the little town where I'm from<br>
                                If only I could swim or sail across to the Mirage City where my prayers<br>
                                are answered by the Lord</p>

                            <p>I can't wait to leave this nightmare behind<br>
                                I see it so clearly now; you're springtime and I'm ice<br>
                                So I'll leave you with a message that I wrote<br>
                                It says: "Your shadow ain't burnt into my soul anymore"</p>

                            <p>So I follow the crow (blood on the road)<br>
                                And the prey of eagles (chained to my throat)<br>
                                I am suffering no more<br>
                                But it's just a mirage in the wind disappearing</p>

                            <p>So I build my own Chimera and face up to it's hate<br>
                                I'm sick of being a scared little cunt that sleeps through all my dreams<br>
                                I'm done with this city and the hurt it's caused<br>
                                Reflection on the back of my shirt<br>
                                I'm done treading water in the sea of doubt<br>
                                I ain't a backpacker caught in a rip, yeah<br>
                                I die if I stay here, reborn if I leave<br>
                                It's time for me to say goodbye to Mirage City</p>

                            <p>Take me away (take me away)<br>
                                I wanna feel them frost flakes on my face again<br>
                                Take me away (take me away)<br>
                                Where the temperature stays below 25/78</p>

                            <p>I felt so at home down here<br>
                                Had to step out of the heat<br>
                                Antarctica that's the place<br>
                                Synthetic breeze on my face<br>
                                I'm a polar bear in denial<br>
                                I can't help but hate the heat (I can't help but hate the heat)</p>

                            <p>It's gonna be a miss I can tell we've got snowball's chance in hell<br>
                                I know this ain't gonna go well<br>
                                Snowball's chance in hell<br>
                                It's gonna be a miss I can tell we've got snowball's chance in hell<br>
                                I know this ain't gonna go well<br>
                                Snowball's chance in hell</p>

                            <p>I made a deal with the devil in the fuselage<br>
                                Crashed into heaven in the dead of winter<br>
                                Walked on thin ice and got snowed under<br>
                                Caught my death and got iced over<br>
                                Got cold feet and a cold shoulder<br>
                                Ice in my veins and frost in my heart<br>
                                The cold hard truth is I'm the polar opposite<br>
                                Carved a hole in heaven like an icebreaker</p>

                            <p>Fahrenheit or Celsius<br>
                                Tell me what your policy is<br>
                                Are we talking the same language?<br>
                                It won't matter in utopia<br>
                                Antarctica is the place for the cold embrace</p>

                            <p>(Take me away, take me away)<br>
                                Antarctica, that's the place for me<br>
                                (Take me away, take me away)<br>
                                It's the place where the frost flakes spell out my name<br>
                                (Take me away, take me away)<br>
                                There's a polar bear calling out my name<br>
                                (take me away, take me away)<br>
                                He's telling me that a sunny day ain't got shit on this place</p>

                            <p>Ahhhh Ohhhh!<br>
                                Ahhhh Ohhhh!<br>

                                (Take me away, take me away...)<br>
                                Ahhhh Ohhhh!<br>
                                (Take me away, take me away...)</p>

                            <p>When you got it made (When you got it made)<br>
                                When you got it made (When you got it made)<br>
                                It's just the tip of the iceberg (It's just the tip of the iceberg)<br>
                                It's just the tip of the iceberg so put it on ice (You gotta put it on, you gotta put it
                                on...)<br>
                                You gotta put it on ice (You gotta put it on, you gotta put it on...)<br>
                                You gotta put it on ice in our discontented winter, and let that cool air blow away your
                                every care</p>

                            <p>How does it feel<br>
                                To you when you're circling the drain?<br>
                                Is it for real?<br>
                                Can you ever know you're feeling pain?<br>
                                Because experience is different for everyone<br>
                                One thing for me might be three for some<br>
                                You can never know this, but you think you do<br>
                                The same shit for me ain't the same shit for you</p>

                            <p>What does the sunlight feel like on your skin?<br>
                                Does it smell like the sound of a pill kickin' in?<br>
                                Or the taste of a song that makes you want to scream?<br>
                                Raw feels for you, feel raw to me</p>

                            <p>Do your insides churn when you take a wrong turn?<br>
                                Do you feel the hurt when you're bogged down in the dirt?<br>
                                Do you keep on trucking when the lesson's learned?<br>
                                And if you're feeling nothin', well, that's a concern</p>

                            <p>What I see is poles apart from your sunken eyes<br>
                                Your blue wall is green to me<br>
                                Why are you surprised?<br>
                                I've always pondered feeling needle on my skin<br>
                                Is it pure bliss or complete chagrin?</p>

                            <p>Raw feel (Raw feel)<br>
                                Raw feel (Raw feel)<br>
                                Raw feel (Raw feel)<br>
                                What's your Achilles' heel?</p>

                            <p>I'm breaking through<br>
                                This is a sensory moment I'm all about sharing with you<br>
                                I'm seeing things through the flesh<br>
                                This feeling's raw and it feels the best<br>
                                Peel my skin back; what do you see?<br>
                                You and me, with a raw sensibility</p>

                            <p>We'll dig to hell and back so you can see the devil's lair<br>
                                We'll fly to heaven and home just to feel wind in your hair<br>
                                We'll climb the highest peak to smell an air of different kind<br>
                                We'll shoot an arrow through the sun to hear exploding skies<br>
                                Into forgotten caves to taste an ancient wine, and dream myself into the forest of your
                                mind<br>
                                Can we ever know?<br>
                                Does it matter if we don't?<br>
                                Be at peace<br>
                                Be internal<br>
                                The gentle flow is tranquil</p>

                            <p>Raw feel for you<br>
                                Raw feel for me<br>
                                Raw feel for everyone<br>
                                Raw feel for you<br>
                                Raw feel for me<br>
                                Raw feel for everyone<br>

                                Yeah, the thunder of the hooves<br>
                                Run from the pack of wolves<br>
                                The drumming of the limbs<br>
                                Overtake the wind<br>
                                Living in a field of vision</p>

                            <p>Big ride, leather-eyed, with a one-track mind<br>
                                One race, one course<br>
                                Fly upon the metal horse<br>
                                Goose for the sauce<br>
                                Get bruised, get loose, attitude, blindfold me<br>
                                I can see the music<br>
                                Woo!</p>

                            <p>Look at me (Field of vision)<br>
                                You and your orchid of eyes (Cyclopean)<br>
                                Sight can sting (Field of vision)<br>
                                I'm thinking that it's harvest time, yeah</p>

                            <p>I lied to God<br>
                                Faith dead, stage plot<br>

                                I glide</p>

                                I made a silk purse from my ears (I made a silk purse from my ears)</p>

                            <p>I wanna wine and dine 'ya, I'm a feral swine (Dine)<br>
                                That'd turn down Miss Piggy to make you mine (Mine)</p>

                                What if the rat eats the king cobra?<br>
                                Does that mean the turtles win the race?</p>

                            <p>I've got sweat beading down my spine, that's the feeling of a swine taking off<br>
                                This flight's gonna crash; and then my hooves start to thrash and then my teeth start to
                                gnash until we hit the ground<br>

                                My heart cannot beat fast enough<br>
                                The risk is technicolour paint<br>
                                One life, (one life)<br>
                                one chance (one chance)<br>

                                I long for that feel of romance</p>

                                Is this the place I want to be? (far, far away)<br>
                                I've got to make this pilgrimage (far, far, far)<br>
                                Throwing off these chains (up in the sky)<br>
                                I see across the sky where I need to be</p>

                            <p>Well picture me far away<br>
                                It's hard enough to say that you'd given it all up and fly away<br>
                                There's a hundred million steps between here and where I'd wanna be<br>
                                Until I take the journey there's no other place I think I'd rather be</p>

                            <p>Well, I've never traveled lonesome<br>
                                As the feeling goes, this plane is going down with me on</p>

                            <p>The splatter of the engine and the creaking of the skeleton, composing a requiem<br>
                                I'm frightened<br>
                                If only we were at sea level, sailing a waterborne vessel<br>
                                Memory, my only anchor<br>
                                I love you<br>
                                In another life, I would have thought about it twice, I would have taken your advice, I
                                would have said "I'm sorry"<br>
                                If by some unlikely chance my plane miraculously lands, I'll live every moment I can in
                                gratitude</p>

                            <p>Darlin', I, I'll do it for you and do it again until the plane can't move<br>
                                I'll go back to school and learn to fly<br>
                                No plane can stop me from falling to you<br>
                                Baby I'll be seeing you from above the storm, through a cyclone's eye<br>
                                Your wings are mine; they keep me gliding across auroras until I'm home</p>

                            <p>Have you traveled far?<br>
                                Far, far away (far, far, far)<br>
                                Throwing off these chains (up in the sky)<br>
                                I see across the sky where I need to be</p>

                            <p>What if we fall out of the sky?<br>
                                Is there even air to hold us?<br>
                                How are we floating here?<br>
                                This makes no sense; I wanna go home</p>

                                Seems as though I've hit a roadblock<br>
                                My wheels ain't pulling up, they keep dragging down<br>
                                I've got a lot of fuel to burn<br>

                            <p>I'd rather be amongst the clouds, elevated, elevated in the sky<br>
                                Don't care too much, yeah, for the ground<br>
                                Elevated rats in the sky<br>
                                Liquid gurgling coos<br>
                                My neck is bobbling like a bobble head from a high-rise city view apartment<br>
                                Rainbow oil puddle<br>
                                Greasy sheen<br>

                                Internal compass paves the way<br>
                                I'd rather be amongst the clouds, elevated, elevated in the sky<br>
                                Don't care too much, yeah, for the ground<br>
                                Elevated rats in the sky</p>

                            <p>I'm so goddamn filthy<br>
                                Am I a pet or is this man trying to kill me?<br>
                                Take my little hood off and set me free, so I can join the other feathered rats at the
                                bar<br>
                                There's the garbage man with a scar on his heart<br>
                                Primordial reasons got me thinking that we're not so far apart<br>
                                Not so far<br>
                                Filth rats in the sky<br>
                                Not so far apart</p>

                            <p>Sky borne rats don't lie<br>
                                I'm making a detour by the pub to eat a little lunch and take a load off<br>
                                The garbage man knows we're a symbiotic duo<br>
                                Look out for that cat named Bruno</p>

                            <p>Bread crusts are my banquet<br>
                                Puddles are my wine<br>
                                I revel in the present<br>
                                Each moment, a lifetime<br>
                                I need only flap my wings and I'm where I want to be<br>
                                This cruel city that I love<br>
                                My crumb kingdom<br>
                                And doesn't Planet Earth look good from this perch<br>
                                Rats in the sky<br>
                                Eat, fly, survive</p>

                            <p>Their mind is miles from their bodies<br>
                                Forgot the joy of simply being<br>
                                They miss the magic of the mundane<br>
                                The way raindrops race down windowpanes<br>
                                Always hurrying, never arriving<br>
                                Nothing truly dangerous, nothing surprising<br>
                                Liberated by wings, unburdened by worry<br>
                                Forgot the destination but enjoyed the journey</p>

                            <p>Joke's on you, you stupid men<br>
                                I just went to the costume shop, and bought myself some wings<br>
                                I'm a rat</p>
