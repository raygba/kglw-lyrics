                                I'm not lonely<br>
                                The city keeps me company<br>
                                The city keeps me company<br>
                                The city keeps me company</p>
                            <p>Sit on the roof<br>
                                Watch the cars travel past<br>
                                Ain't no way of getting lonely<br>
                                I'll sit real still and watch everyone go fast<br>
                                With only me</p>
                            <p>Lay on the bay<br>
                                Watch it all float away<br>
                                Ain't no way of getting lonely<br>
                                Watch all the people and the bikes come my way<br>
                                With only me</p>
