                            Fishing for fishies<br>
                            Don't make them feel happy<br>
                            Or me neither<br>

                            Ego tied in knots, baiting fate<br>

                            You ain't a god<br>

                            And shot the policeman<br>
                            And went down to the nightclub<br>
                            And shocked all the patrons<br>

                            He stole from a punter, the exact shoes he wanted<br>
                            To carve holes in the floorboards<br>
                            And dance like a demon<br>

                            I try to be primed for a reason to go back to sleep<br>
                            That's not to say there's no relief<br>

                            I hide my riches in embarrassing sheets<br>
                            That reek of suspicious happenings<br>
                            'Cause I'm a different person and that will make you sick<br>
                            There's no stopping what this is<br><br>

                            Cyboogie, lump in his throat<br>
                            Palpitations and nausea ensue<br>
                            Cyboogie's chorophobia<br>
                            Terminal error vascular tissue<br>
                            So Cyboogie's fishing for fishies<br>
                            Red-bellied trout in a binary brook<br>
                            How is it that he is depressed?<br>
                            The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook<br><br>

                            Cyboogie, cyboogie<br>
                            Cyboogie, cyboogie<br>
                            Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie<br>
