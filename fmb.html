                            <p>I know something is lurking in<br>
                                The depths of murky water<br>
                                There are ripples and bubbles appearing<br>
                                Over by the sunken ship</p>

                            <p>And bells are ringing in my head<br>
                                I think I'm done - I think I'm dead<br>
                                As something pulls my paddling leg under…</p>

                            <p>Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take<br>
                                This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs<br>

                            <p>And deeper darker bluish dread<br>
                                The pressure's squeezing on my head<br>
                                The kraken's got the best of me this time</p>

                            <p>I know something is lurking in<br>
                                The depths of murky water<br>
                                There are ripples and bubbles appearing<br>
                                Over by the sunken ship</p>

                            <p>And bells are ringing in my head<br>
                                I think I'm done - I think I'm dead<br>
                                As something pulls my paddling leg under…</p>

                            <p>Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take<br>
                                This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs</p>

                            <p>And deeper darker bluish dread<br>
                                The pressure's squeezing on my head<br>
                                The kraken's got the best of me this time</p>

                            <p>Open water<br>
                                Where's the shore gone?<br>
                                How'd I falter?<br>
                                Open water</p>
