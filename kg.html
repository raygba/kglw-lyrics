                                I think I'm taking off<br>

                                Will I evaporate?<br>
                                Is this me feeling something?<br>
                                I've got a bird's eye view<br>
                                I have shed my skin<br>

                            <p>I used to dream about killing certain people<br>
                                Dreams that sew me up like sleeping with a needle<br>
                                Those feelings that I had were building up to something<br>
                                I feel a schism in the rhythm<br>
                                Now I'm running</p>
                            <p>My hair is liquifying<br>
                                My tastebuds are igniting<br>
                                It's true I am evolving<br>
                                It's all relative</p>

                                Definitely feeling something<br>
                                I've got a bird's eye view<br>
                                I have shed my skin<br>
